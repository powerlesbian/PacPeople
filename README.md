# PacPeople
the gender neutral version of Pac

Description of project: PacPeople just rolls off the tongue doesn't it?!  Yes, I know Pacmen is what we're used to as kids, but we're kinda grown up now and we've learned that it's not good to impose gender stereotypes and gender normativity into coding. So anyway, PacPeople is a fun screensaver type program where you can add lots of Pac onto the screen according to what the main Pac, who just runs back and forth on the screen, is doing.  When it gets a bit too much you can click stop craziness. 


How to Run: Just load, click and run.  If after you've clicked stop craziness you want to start it all again, you have to refresh your screen. 

Roadmap of future improvements: Navigation on to previous page in-page would be good, as well as other gender expressions of Pac would be cool, don't you think?
